## Note Regarding This Repository

This project was made during the early stages of my journey into web development. At that time, I was exploring various concepts and learning through hands-on experience. While this project served as a valuable learning experience, I recognize that the code structure, reusability, and overall code quality may not meet the standards I uphold in my more recent work.

Please keep in mind that my skills and approach to web development have evolved significantly since the creation of this project. I have gained a deeper understanding of code organization, best practices, and design principles. My more recent projects reflect the progress I have made as a developer.

While this repository may not reflect my current abilities, I have chosen to keep it accessible as a reminder of my growth and the journey I have undertaken. If you're interested in exploring my more recent and polished work, I encourage you to take a look at my other repositories.

Thank you for understanding and for considering my more recent projects as a better representation of my current skills and approach.

# Automobile Management System
A web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MYSQL.
<br>
<br>
This project is completely concept-based targeting those customers who prefer custom-made cars rather than pre-build models. In this Web App, you can register/log in using a valid email account and have complete access to order your custom car. It lets you choose each major individual part to make a complete set for a car. This Web App is beginner-friendly with all the required information provided with the help of diagrams.
<br>
<br>
For practical use, the concept behind it is to let customers choose parts to make a complete car, which is later analyzed and followed back by the engineering professionals with a model or request for changes and then later passed to the manufacturer. It is mainly brought as a service-oriented company that is willing to provide service to customers surpassing their service limit.
