# Automobile Management System
A web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MYSQL.

<br>
This project is completely concept-based targeting those customers who prefer custom-made cars rather than pre-build models. In this Web App, you can register/log in using a valid email account and have complete access to order your custom car. It lets you choose each major individual part to make a complete set for a car. This Web App is beginner-friendly with all the required information provided with the help of diagrams.
<br>
<br>
For practical use, the concept behind it is to let customers choose parts to make a complete car, which is later analyzed and followed back by the engineer professionals with a model or request for changes and then later passed to the manufacturer. It is mainly brought as a service-oriented company that is willing to provide service to customers surpassing their service limit.
